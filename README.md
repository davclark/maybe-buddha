# maybe-buddha
A helpful virtual agent

For now, there is only one sub-project called `scrape-n-mail`.

All source-code is available at https://github.com/davclark/maybe-buddha

## Terms of Service

This site was constructed to support my own activities tending to a Dharma
community. If I have not expressly invited you to use a tool hosted here,
please don't use it!

You are welcome to fork the code (linked above) and adapt it to your own needs.
Or get in touch!

## Privacy Policy

The only application hosted here (`scrape-n-mail`) simply fetches data from
Google Sheets that you are already authorized to access. This data is displayed
to you in a format suitable for a monthly email. Authentication and data
fetching happens solely within the browser. No data is saved on any server.
Data may persist in your local browser, but we are not currently using any data
here that would be a concern.
